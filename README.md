Laws and Logic
====================

## Overview

Laws and Logic is an attempt at parsing logical formulas (written in linear logic) into a natrual language using [Grammatical Framework][GF]. The program is intended to be able to read formulas describing voting protocols and generate proper, understandable sentences from it.

Laws and Logic is a project written by a bachelor student at the IT-University at Copenhagen.

## Current program

1. The program is capable of parsing logical formulars (see the [Test file](https://github.com/jcgr/GrammaticalFramework/blob/master/Laws/Laws7/Test.txt) for examples). Note that it uses static identifiers, as it is specific for the voting protocols.
2. The sentences it returns in English / Danish are understandable.
3. The program supports mathematical operations.
4. The program uses user defined variables.
