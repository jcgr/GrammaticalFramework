\label{01}

This report is the result of a bachelor project on the bachelor line in Software Development at the IT-University of Copenhagen spanning from the 2nd of February 2013 to the 22nd of May 2013.

The goal of the project was to write a program using Grammatical Framework\footnote{http://www.grammaticalframework.org/} that could translate formulas written in linear logic into a natrual language. The idea behind the program was to translate logical formulas describing the laws about voting protocols into sentences more descriptive than the current ones. (?)
