\section{Limitations of the program}
\label{04_04}

The program can parse logical formulas and translate them into decent English sentences. There are some limitations, however, which will be described in this section.

\subsection{Static identifiers}
\label{04_04_01}

The identifiers are all static. This means that if other identifiers were to be used, or one wanted to use it for other logcial formulars, the code has to be changed. \note{more}

\subsection{Sentence construction}
\label{04_04_02}

The sentences in the program are static. The only thing that changes is the argument given. Because of this, the sentences may not convey the exact meaning in some cases, mainly when they are on the right side of the $\lolli$. \note{more}

\subsection{Additional languages}
\label{04_04_03}

With the way the program is built right now, translating it into other languages is a bit difficult. It requires the translator to know the other language well, as he has to translate complete sentences properly. \note{More. Remeber grammar resources in GF}
