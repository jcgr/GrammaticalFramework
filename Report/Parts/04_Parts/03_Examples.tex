\section{Running the Program}
\label{04_03}

In this section, I will show the result of parsing some of the logical formulas into the program.

\subsection{The example}

The first formula to be run, is the one from the example in section \ref{02_01}. As the program has been written to accept Celf's syntax, I will use the version of the formula from section \ref{03_01_03}:

\begin{texto2}
	\formula{tally-votes S H U * uncounted-ballot C L * hopeful C N * !quota Q * !nat-lesseq Q (p ! N) -o \{ counted-ballot C L * !elected C * tally-votes (s ! S) (s ! H) (s ! U) \} }
\end{texto2}

Before this will run, however, the variables will have to be specified through universal quantifications. Without that, the formula will not parse. Furthermore, GF needs spaces around each individual element, and the plus/minus (p/s ! x) will need a couple of spaces introduced. I will this manually and let the reader confirm that the result is, in fact, the same formula:

\begin{texto2}
	\formula{Pi C : candidate . Pi H : nat . Pi L : list . Pi N : nat . Pi Q : nat . Pi S : nat . Pi U : nat . Pi W : list . tally-votes S H U * uncounted-ballot C L * hopeful C N * !quota Q * !nat-lesseq Q ( p ! N ) -o \{ counted-ballot C L * !elected C * tally-votes ( s ! S ) ( s ! H ) ( s ! U ) \} }
\end{texto2}

With the formula changed to fit the syntax of the program, we will parse it and have it translated into English. We parse it in GF by writing
\begin{texto2}
p -lang=LawsLin "Pi C : candidate . Pi H : nat . Pi L : list . Pi N : nat . Pi Q : nat . Pi S : nat . Pi U : nat . Pi W : list . tally-votes S H U * uncounted-ballot C L * hopeful C N * !quota Q * !nat-lesseq Q ( p ! N ) -o \{ counted-ballot C L * !elected C * tally-votes ( s ! S ) ( s ! H ) ( s ! U ) \}" $|$ l -treebank
\end{texto2}

What this does, is to tell GF that we want to parse it as the language defined by the -lang flag. After it has been parsed, we tell GF to linearize it  and use the -treebank flag to have it linearized in all the languages that have been loaded. The result is the following:
\begin{texto2}
LawsEng: C is a candidate . H is a natural number . L is a list . N is a natural number . Q is a natural number . S is a natural number . U is a natural number . W is a list . \\
If we are counting votes and there are S seats open, H hopefuls, and U uncounted ballots cast , \\
and there is an uncounted ballot with highest preference for candidate C with a list L of lower preferences , \\
and there is a hopeful candidate C with N counted ballots , \\
and Q votes are needed to be elected , and ( Q is less than or equal to ( N plus 1 ) ) \\
then \{ there is a counted ballot with highest preference for candidate C with a list L of lower preferences , \\
and candidate C has been, and will remain, elected , \\
and we are counting votes and there are ( S minus 1 ) seats open, ( H minus 1 ) hopefuls, and ( U minus 1 ) uncounted ballots cast \}
\end{texto2}
