\chapter{Implementation}
\label{04}

In this chapter we will look at how the program has been written along with the thoughts and reasoning behind different choices. We will first look at the abstract syntax tree followed by the concrete implementations. After the implementations have been explained, we will run the program with the formula from section \ref{03_01_03} and discuss the result. Finally we will look at eventual limitations of the program.
