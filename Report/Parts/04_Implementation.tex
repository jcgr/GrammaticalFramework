\chapter{Implementation}
\label{04}

In this chapter we will look at how the program has been written along with the thoughts and reasoning behind different choices. We will first look at the abstract syntax tree followed by the concrete implementations. After the implementations have been explained, we will run the program on a formula and discuss the result. Finally we will look at the limitations of the program.
