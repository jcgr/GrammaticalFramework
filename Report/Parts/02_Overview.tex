\chapter{Overview}
\label{02}

Throughout this thesis, I will be focusing on the Single-Transferable Vote protocol (STV protocol) from the Linear Logical Voting Protocols\cite{Deyoung11} paper by \citeauthor{Deyoung11}. I will be using the logical formulas from figure 2 on page 9-10 to test the program. The goal is for the program to be able to parse every single formula and create an understandable sentence in English from it.
